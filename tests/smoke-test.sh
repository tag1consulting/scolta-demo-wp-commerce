# Docker smoke test.
#
# Builds the image, stands up a database beside it, loads the committed dump,
# runs the container against it, and asserts:
#   1. the site root returns a 2xx,
#   2. the search route returns a 2xx,
#   3. the Pagefind index metadata is served,
#   4. the index reports at least MIN_PAGES pages.
#
# Two notes on why this script looks the way it does.
#
# First, assertions 1 and 2 must require a success status. An earlier version
# treated any response other than the curl failure code 000 as liveness, so a
# site returning HTTP 500 on every request still printed "image build and start
# OK" and exited 0. A test that cannot fail on a broken site is worse than no
# test, because every later run inherits the false confidence.
#
# Second, this image has no database of its own: it ships a mysql client and
# reads DB_HOST and friends from the environment, exactly as the production
# deployment does. Running it bare therefore always yields HTTP 500, and a 2xx
# assertion would be unsatisfiable. So the test provisions the same thing the
# Helm chart provisions: a database loaded from db/dump.sql.gz. That makes a
# 500 here mean the demo is broken, which is the whole point.
